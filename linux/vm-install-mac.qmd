### Prequisites

m series mac with macOS

### Steps

1. If you do not already have Homebrew, install it by opening a terminal and running the following command. Otherwise skip this step.

    ```sh
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2. Install multipass with the following command.

    ```sh
    brew install multipass
    ```

3. Run the one of the following multipass command to create an instance with the name csc222 (or whatever you want to name it).

    ```sh
    # for a minimal machine with default specs (1 cpu, 5G disk space, 1G memory, )
    multipass launch 22.04 --name csc222
    ```

    ```sh
    # for a more powerful machine that can have space for a gui
    multipass launch 22.04 --name csc222 --cpus 2 --memory 4G --disk 50G
    ```
    
4. Once the machine is finished setting up. You can access it with the following command. If you named it something other than `csc222`, use that in place of `csc222`.

    ```sh
    multipass shell csc222
    ```

5. Once access to the machine is granted, create a user in the machine for yourself. The example below adds a user named josh.

    ```sh
    sudo adduser josh
    ```

6. To add yourself to the group of users that can use the command `sudo`, run the following, but use your username, not josh.

    ```sh
    sudo usermod -aG sudo josh
    ```

### (Optional) Add a GUI to your machine

1. In the shell on your VM, run the following commands. Note that this may take a few minutes.

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop xrdp
    ```

2. While the second command is processing, download Microsoft Remote Desktop on your mac by going to the app store. 

    [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12)

3. Open another Terminal on your mac and and type `multipass list` to get the IP address of the machine. It should be something like 10.49.93.209 or 192.168.64.6 (not that exactly, but similar).

4. Open Microsoft RDP and add the connection.
