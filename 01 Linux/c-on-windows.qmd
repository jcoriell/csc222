title: Setup for C on Windows
---

To run C programs in Windows (64 bit):

1. Go to this address and select the second tdm-gcc compiler (tdm64-gcc-10.3.0-2.exe): https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/
2. Run the installer and select "Create"
3. Click through the install with the next button until complete

You should now be able to use gcc in command prompt as in Linux

To ensure Windows Defender does not delete compiled executables:

1. Create a folder in which you work on C programs (For me it is in a CSC222 folder on my desktop)
2. Open Windows Security in the search bar
3. Select Virus and Threat Protection
4. Under "Virus & threat protection updates" select Manage Settings
5. Scroll down to Exclusions, and select Add or remove exclusions
6. Select Add an exclusion
7. Select Folder
8. Navigate to and select the folder where your C programs will be stored

You should now be able to compile and run C programs as long as they are in this folder.
