title: Case
---

## Example with Numeric Options

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# The case construct is like a switch case
# Begin with case and then list out the options
# End with esac (case backwards)

# Example: 

# Provide a prompt with options
echo "What is your favorite food? "

echo "1 - Pizza"
echo "2 - Chicken"
echo "3 - Burgers"

# Read in the response (a 1, 2, or 3)
read food;

case $food in 
   1) echo "Pizza is a great choice";;    # The ;; marks the end of a case block
   2) echo "You chose chicken"            # You can have multiple commands per case
      echo "Mmm. Canes, Popeyes, yes."
      ;;
   3) echo "Burgers are great!";;
   *) echo "That wasn't an option";;  # use * for default
esac
```

## Non-numeric Example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# The options do not have to be numbers, it can be any pattern.

# Example: 

# Provide a prompt with options
printf "What do you drive? "

# Read in the response
read vehicle;


case $vehicle in 
   car) 
      echo "You drive a car."        
      echo "Is there a car directory in this folder?"
      if [[ -d "car" ]]
      then
         echo "There is"
      else
         echo "There is not"
      fi
      ;;
   truck) 
      echo "You drive a truck";;
   van) 
      echo "You drive a van";;
   *) 
      echo "That wasn't an option";;
esac
```
