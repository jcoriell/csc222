title: Grep and Regex
---

## Grep

Grep is a command used to search through the contents of files using regular expressions. A regular expression is a sequence of characters that represents a search pattern. 

Grep stands for **G**lobally search for a **R**egular **E**xpression and **P**rint

A typical format for using the grep command is as follows:

```sh
grep [flags] [search string] [file or files]
```

### Common Flags
The following are some common flags on may use with grep and their meaning. This is not an exhaustive list. For more information on the flags, use the `man grep` command.

```
Flag        Meaning
-i          ignore case for the search string
-r          search recursively into a directory and the files in that directory
-c          count the number of lines the search string occurrs on in each file
-o          show each occurrence on its own line when the result is printed
-P          allow the use of PCRE (Perl Compatible regular expressions)
```

Concerning the last flag, we will be using Perl compatible regular expresssions as it greatly enhannces pattern matching and allows for more concise expressions compared to standard regular expressions.

Any of the above flags can be combined, as will be shown in a few examples that follow.

## grep on macOS
If you're using macOS, the built in grep command does not highlight the matches when printing the result like it does in Ubuntu. To get highlighted matches, download GNU grep using the command `brew install grep`. If you do not have homebrew installed, install instructions are found at (https://brew.sh/)[https://brew.sh/]{target="_blank"}.

After installing, use the command `ggrep` in place of `grep`.

You can use the flag `--color` with `ggrep` to force text highlighting.
