## find

- Typically used to find a file or directory.

- Recall grep is typically used to find patterns inside files
    


```sh
# Example with find
find . -name "test1.txt"
```

## &&, ||, and ;

- Use `&&`, `||` and `;` to chain commands together

- The command before `&&` must complete without error for the command after `&&` to execute

    ```sh
    # example with success on first command
    echo "hi" > test.txt && echo "hello.txt"
    ```

    ```sh
    # example with an error on the first command with &&
    find . --name "test1.txt" && echo ok

    # after fixing the error
    find . -name "test1.txt" && echo ok
    ```

- The command before `||` must result in an error for the command after `||` to execute

    ```sh
    # example with || with an error
    find . --name "test1.txt" || echo error

    # after fixing the error
    find . -name "test1.txt" || echo error        # no error
    ```

- Use `;` to just separate two commands on the same line

    ```sh
    # echo ok happens even though find will throw and error
    find --name test1.txt; echo ok
    ```
