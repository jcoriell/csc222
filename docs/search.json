    "text": "Introduction\nFollow the steps below to set up an Ubuntu LTS Machine on your m series chip Mac (m1, m2, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot sure on chip type?\n\n\n\nClick the  icon on the menubar and select About this mac.... It should be indicated under the “Chip” category if it is an m series chip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have an m series chip…\n\n\n\nIf your mac is not an m series mac, then follow the windows install.\n\n\n\n\nPrequisites\nm series mac with macOS\n\n\nSteps\n\nIf you do not already have Homebrew, install it by opening a terminal and running the following command. Otherwise skip this step.\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nInstall multipass with the following command.\nbrew install multipass\nRun the one of the following multipass command to create an instance with the name csc222 (or whatever you want to name it).\n# for a minimal machine with default specs (1 cpu, 5G disk space, 1G memory, )\nmultipass launch 22.04 --name csc222\n# for a more powerful machine that can have space for a gui\nmultipass launch 22.04 --name csc222 --cpus 2 --memory 4G --disk 50G\nOnce the machine is finished setting up. You can access it with the following command. If you named it something other than csc222, use that in place of csc222.\nmultipass shell csc222\nOnce access to the machine is granted, create a user in the machine for yourself. The example below adds a user named josh.\nsudo adduser josh\nTo add yourself to the group of users that can use the command sudo, run the following, but use your username, not josh.\nsudo usermod -aG sudo josh\n\n\n\n(Optional) Add a GUI to your machine\n\nIn the shell on your VM, run the following commands. Note that this may take a few minutes.\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install ubuntu-desktop xrdp\nWhile the second command is processing, download Microsoft Remote Desktop on your mac by going to the app store.\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop\nOpen another Terminal on your mac and and type multipass list to get the IP address of the machine. It should be something like 10.49.93.209 or 192.168.64.6 (not that exactly, but similar).\nOpen Microsoft RDP and add the connection."

The ^ symbol means ctrl. So ^x means to type ctrl + x\nnano ~/.bashrc\ngedit - a GUI based text editor\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nThe following helpful aliases can be added to the end of the file:\nalias c='clear'\nalias h='history'\nalias j='jobs'\nalias ls='ls -CF --group-directories-first --color=auto $*'\nalias lss='ls -Alh $*'\nalias m='more'\nalias p='ps -ef'\nalias ~='cd ~'\n\nFinally, load them into the current terminal via: source ~/.bashrc"
