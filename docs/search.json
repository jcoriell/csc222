Otherwise skip this step.\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nInstall multipass with the following command.\nbrew install multipass\nRun the one of the following multipass command to create an instance with the name csc222 (or whatever you want to name it).\n# for a minimal machine with default specs (1 cpu, 5G disk space, 1G memory, )\nmultipass launch 22.04 --name csc222\n# for a more powerful machine that can have space for a gui\nmultipass launch 22.04 --name csc222 --cpus 2 --memory 4G --disk 50G\nOnce the machine is finished setting up. You can access it with the following command. If you named it something other than csc222, use that in place of csc222.\nmultipass shell csc222\nOnce access to the machine is granted, create a user in the machine for yourself. The example below adds a user named josh.\nsudo adduser josh\nTo add yourself to the group of users that can use the command sudo, run the following, but use your username, not josh.\nsudo usermod -aG sudo josh\n\n\n\n(Optional) Add a GUI to your machine\n\nIn the shell on your VM, run the following commands. Note that this may take a few minutes.\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install ubuntu-desktop xrdp\nWhile the second command is processing, download Microsoft Remote Desktop on your mac by going to the app store.\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop\nOpen another Terminal on your mac and and type multipass list to get the IP address of the machine. It should be something like 10.49.93.209 or 192.168.64.6 (not that exactly, but similar).\nOpen Microsoft RDP and add the connection."

    "text": "History of Unix Like Systems\n\n1969 The Unix operating system is developed by AT&T/Bell Laboratories.\n\nFirst developed with Assembly but moved to primarily C\nSince it was primarily C, it was very portable\nAT&T cannot sell it due to agreements not to enter the computing business\nAT&T opts to distribute it under licenses to Labs and Universities\n\n1977 UC Berkly developed BSD (Berkley Software Distribution) as a Unix-like replacement.\n\nIt contained code owned by AT&T\nWill eventually lead to a lawsuit from AT&T\n\n1983 GNU Operating System (Pronounced Guh-nu) started by Richard Stallman\n\nIts purpose was to be a free/open unix-like replacement for UNIX (that didn’t contain any code owned by AT&T).\nGNU stands for GNU is Not Unix\nGNU’s kernel is GNU Hurd (started in 1990, before Linux, doesn’t become stable until 2001)\n\nNote: The kernel of an OS is the system between the hardware and software of a machine. Main function is process, memory, and other resource management.\nThe OS is the system as a whole; interface between user and hardware. An OS contains a kernel, applications, device drivers, utilities, etc.\n\n\n1991\n\nFinnish Grad Student Linus Torvalds emails about the OS he is working on.\nLinux kernel is developed\n\n1992\n\nBSDi gets sued by AT&T, which slowed BSD development.\nThe Linux kernel becomes the kernel for GNU.\nGNU/Linux is released as Free software under the GNU General Purpose License.\n\nNote: When we say “Linux”, we really mean GNU/Linux. Linux is just the kernel.\n\nGNU License gave developers the ability to make custom OSs that felt like UNIX without the fear of being sued.\n\n1993 The Debian distrobution is born\n\nOne of the most popular distros/family of distros\nMinimal, stable, good for general purpose pc usage and servers alike.\nMost distros are children of Debian including Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, and SteamOS.\n\n1994 The Redhat Distrobution is born\n\nPrimarily used for enterprise\nDistros in the Redhat family include Fedora (Distro of choice for Linus Torvalds) and CentOS\n\n2000/2002 Gentoo/Arch are born as more simplistic families of distrobutions\nIn later 2000s we see some independent distros we are more familiar with such as\n\nFireOS (Amazon FireStick/Fire devices)\nAndroid (Google)\n\nFun Fact: Linus Torvalds also created git for version control.\n\nDistro Family Tree\nSource: A large portion of the information above comes from GNU’s Website"
