Otherwise skip this step.\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nInstall multipass with the following command.\nbrew install multipass\nRun the one of the following multipass command to create an instance with the name csc222 (or whatever you want to name it).\n# for a minimal machine with default specs (1 cpu, 5G disk space, 1G memory, )\nmultipass launch 22.04 --name csc222\n# for a more powerful machine that can have space for a gui\nmultipass launch 22.04 --name csc222 --cpus 2 --memory 4G --disk 50G\nOnce the machine is finished setting up. You can access it with the following command. If you named it something other than csc222, use that in place of csc222.\nmultipass shell csc222\nOnce access to the machine is granted, create a user in the machine for yourself. The example below adds a user named josh.\nsudo adduser josh\nTo add yourself to the group of users that can use the command sudo, run the following, but use your username, not josh.\nsudo usermod -aG sudo josh\n\n\n\n(Optional) Add a GUI to your machine\n\nIn the shell on your VM, run the following commands. Note that this may take a few minutes.\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install ubuntu-desktop xrdp\nWhile the second command is processing, download Microsoft Remote Desktop on your mac by going to the app store.\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop\nOpen another Terminal on your mac and and type multipass list to get the IP address of the machine. It should be something like 10.49.93.209 or 192.168.64.6 (not that exactly, but similar).\nOpen Microsoft RDP and add the connection."

    "text": "Phase 4: Linking\n\nThe command which ld will show you where the assembler is on your machine.\nNotice that our hello program calls the printf function, which is part of the standard C library provided by every C compiler. The printf function resides in a separate precompiled object file called printf.o, which must somehow be merged with our hello.o program. The linker (ld) handles this merging. The result is the hello file, which is an ‘executable object file’ (or an executable) that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by the system.\nLinker input: hello.o\nLinker output: hello (executable file)\nTo stop the compilation process after this step, just compile like you have previously. Ex: gcc hello.c -o hello.",

Some common commands:\n            - w to save\n            - q to quit\n            - wq or x to save and quit\n            - q! to quit without saving\n            - e [filename] to open a file\n            - saveas [filename] to save the file as a new name\n            - [an integer] to jump to a line\n\n\nExample\n\nUse the following two commands to create a file somewhere on your system.\ncd ~/Desktop/programs               # navigate to a folder to complete the example in\nvim random_number_generator.py      # open a file (it is ok if the file doesn't exist yet)\nAt this point vim should have opened.\nType i to enter insert mode and type the following code.\nimport random\n\nprint(random.randint())\nNow hit escape to exit insert mode.\nMove the cursor to the beginning of the word randint\nHit v to enter visual mode.\nUse the e key to go to the END of the word (b goes to the Beginning)\nUse the c key to CHANGE the selected text to random. (we are replacing randint with random)\nAt this point the python code should look like this:\nimport random\n\nprint(random.random())\nUse escape to exit insert mode.\nUse : to enter command mode.\nType wq and hit enter to save and exit.\nIf you’d like to run the code, use the following command:\npython3 random_number_generator.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is recommended at this point that you run the vimtutor command if you’d like to learn more about using vim.\n\n\n\n\n\nNano\n\na simple to use terminal based text editor\nlittle to no learning curve\n\n\nExample\nIn this example, we create a file and add “hello world” to it using nano.\n\nRun the following commands\ncd ~/Desktop/programs       # navigate to a folder to store a file\ntouch helloworld.py\nnano helloworld.py\nAt this point, the file should be open.

Recall that hexadecimal uses the characters 0 through 9 and A - F to represent the base 10 quantities of 0 through 15.\nIn C, we can represent our hexadecimal values by putting a 0x in front of them. We will use this notation moving foward to represent hex values.\nExample:\n// the hex value FA1D37B in c\nint num = 0xFA1D37B\nNotice that each character in hex represents 4-bits or half a byte.

Unlike the term byte where a byte always represents 8 bits, the word-size of one machine is not necessarily the same number of bits from one machine to another.\nThe word size of a machine is the nominal size of integer-valued data. On a 64-bit machine, ints are typically 8 bytes (i.e. 64 bits), thus the word size is 64-bits. On 32-bit machines, ints are typically 4 bytes (i.e. 32-bits), thus the word size is 32-bits.\nNote that the integer size of the machine may or may not be the size of an int for a specific language. In c, when we declare ints, they are 4 bytes, even on most 64-bit machines.\nMost current machines are 64-bit (8 bytes) - potentially address 1.8 * 10^19 bytes - Older machines are 32-bits (4 bytes) - limits addresses to 4GB - too small for memory intensive applications - Machines support multiple data formats - Fractions or multiples of word size - Always integral number of bytes\nWord-Oriented Memory Organization - Addresses specifiy Byte Locations - Address of the first byte in word - Addresses of successive words differ by 4 (32-bit) or 8 (64-bit)",

Find the binary representation of x &lt;&lt; 3.\nSolution:\n\n0x62 in binary is 1100010\nHowever, recall that ints are 4 bytes, or 32-bits.\nThus, 0x62 in memory is as follows\n00000000 00000000 00000000 01100010\nNote that we have space separated the bytes for visual purposes.\nNow if we shift the bits 3 places to the left, we get the following:\n00000000 00000000 00000011 00010000\n\n\n\nExample 2\nLet x = 0x62 be an unsigned char. Find the binary representation of x &lt;&lt; 3.\nSolution:\n\n0x62 in binary is 1100010\nHowever, recall that ints are 1 byte, or 8-bits.\nThus, 0x62 in memory is as follows\n01100010\nNote that we only added a leading zero.\nNow if we shift the bits 3 places to the left, we get the following:\n00010000\nNotice how we lost several bits in the shift.\n\n\n\nExample 3\nLet x = -8 (base 10) be an signed char. Find the binary representation of x &gt;&gt; 2.\nSolution:\n\n-8 in binary, as an unsigned char is 11111000\nRecall that this uses two’s complement notation.\nIf we shift the bits 2 places to the right as an arithmetic shift, we get the following:\n11111110\nNotice how the left side was filled with 1s to maintain the sign.\nThe resulting base 10 value is -2.",

    "text": "Hardware Interactions\nTo run our hello.c program, we first have to compile it into an executable object file that is then stored on the disk. We’ve already seen that we can use the gcc compiler to compile the program with the command gcc hello.c -o hello. We will continue to refer to this compiled file as hello. After it is compiled, we can run the executable file on a Unix system by typing its name in the shell as follows:\n$ ./hello\nTo understand what happens to our hello program when we run it, we need to understand the hardware organization of a typical system.\n[include an image of a system’s hardware here]\n\nBuses\nRunning throughout the system is a collection of electical conduits called Buses that carry bytes of information back and forth between components. Busses are typically designed to transfer fixed-sized chunks of data. Most machines now have either 4-byte (32 bit) or 8-byte (64 bit) sized buses. Some examples of bus standards you might be familiar with are the Peripheral Component Interconnect Express bus standard, or PCIe, and the Universal Serial Bus standard, or USB.\n\n\nI/O Devices\nInput/Output (I/O) devices are the system’s connection to the external world. The example system pictured above has 4 I/O devices: Keyboard, mouse, display, and disk.\nInitially, the executable hello program resides on the disk.\n\n\nMain Memory (RAM)\nThe main memory, typiclly Random Access Memory, is a temporary storage device that holds both a program and the data it manipulates while the processor is executing the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Access Memory\n\n\n\nWhy is RAM referred to as random? The word random here means the computer can access any memory location, at random, directly and in the same amount of time, regardless of where that data is stored. That is in contrast to early computer systems that had memory like magnetic tapes that had to be read sequentially.\n\n\n\n\nProcessor\nThe central processing unit (CPU), or just processor, is the engine, or brain that executes instructions stored in main memory. At its core is a register called the ‘program counter’ (PC). At any point in time, the PC points at (contains the address of) some machine language instruction in main memory.\nFrom the time electrical power is applied to the system until power is shut off, a processor repeatedly executes the instruction pointed at by the program counter. The processor ‘reads’ the instruction, pointed at by the PC, ‘interprets’ the bits in the instruction, ‘performs’ some simple operation dictated by the instruction, and then ‘updates’ the PC to point to the next instruction. This is known as the instruction cycle.",

    "text": "The Role of the OS\nWhen the shell loads and runs the hello program, a message of Hello, World! prints to the terminal. However, the executable hello program didn’t access the hardware such as the display, disk, or main memory directly. Rather, it relied on the services provided by the operating system to get the message to appear in the terminal.\n[insert diagram of os acting as intermediary layer]\nWe can think of the operating system as a layer of software interposed between the application program and the hardware. All attempts by an application to manipulate the hardware must go through the operating system.\nThe operating system has two primary purposes:\n\nTo protect the hardware from misuse by runaway applications;\nTo provide applications with simple uniform mechanisms for manipulating complicated and often wildly different low-level hardware devices.\n\nThe operating system achieves both goals via the fundamental abstractions:\n\nprocesses\nvirtual memory\nfiles\n\n\nProcesses\nA process is the operating systems abstraction for a running program. Multiple processes can run concurrently on the same system, and each process assumes it has exclusive use of the hardware.\n\n\nVirtual Memory\nVirtual memory is the abstraction that provides each process with the illusion that is has exclusive use of the main memory. A mapping exists from a process’s virtual memory to the physical memory. A 64-bit machine has a theoretical limit of 2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 memory addresses (or 16 exabytes of virtual memory space), however, they do not use this in practice.\n\n\nFiles\nA file is a sequence of bytes, nothing more, nothing less. Every I/O device (disks, keyboards, displays) is modeled as a file. All input and output in the system is performed by reading and writing files, using a small set of ‘system calls’ known as Unix I/O.",

However, it is still a good experience to have as a computer science student because you won’t always be using the latest and greatest computers.\nYour hard drive will probably have a name like /dev/sda that is the size of all the space you have available for your VM.

    "text": "UNIX Systems\nUNIX operating system is developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories in 1969. It was developed by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and others. Unix was first developed on a PDP-7 in an assembly language, but around 1973 it was rewritten in C, leading to the ability to port it to other machines (a huge innovation at the time!). The first actual port to another platform was made in 1977.\nWhile AT&T distributed the UNIX operating system under licenses to government labs, universities, and industry, other flavors of UNIX were developed. UC Berkeley developed BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) as a Unix-like replacement, although it used some of AT&T’s code. Other flavors of UNIX were developed in the 1980s such as SunOS, AIX, HP-UX, Xenix, and AT&Ts System V as closed and mixed source projects. For a bigger picture of Unix based and Unix-like Operating Systems, see the family tree pictured below.\n\n\n\nUnix Family Tree - Source: https://www.levenez.com/unix/\n\n\nFor more about UNIX, check out Unix: History and Memoir by Brian Kernighan, a Unix developer (approx 45 min of the story, then Q&A).",

    "text": "The GNU Project and Linux\nThe GNU Project (Pronounced Guh-nu) was started by Richard Stallman in the 1983. Its purpose was to be a free/open Unix-like operating system. GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix. The GNU Project lead to the development of the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), an open-source software license that gaurantees users the freedoms to use, study, modify, and share software.\nIn 1991, Linux Torvalds developed an OS kernel that was later named Linux and released it under the GNU GPL in 1992. At the time, the GNU Operating System had many utilities but lacked a stable kernel. Linux and GNU OS developers combined the two projects which resulted in the release of the first Linux based operating system, GNU/Linux.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKernels\n\n\n\nA kernel is the core part of an operating system (OS) that manages essential resources such as memory, processes, devices, and other resources The Linux Information Project - Kernel Definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGNU/Linux\n\n\n\nAlthough we tend to use the term Linux to refer to an operating system, it is more appropriate to say GNU/Linux as Linux is just the kernel. For more on this, visit https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html.\n\n\nSince the development of the original GNU/Linux os, many different operating systems based on the Linux kernel have come about. Some common ones are as follows:\n\nUbuntu - used in this class\nMint - used in CSC 442/CYEN 301\nDebian - Ubuntu’s parent, and the base for many other flavors\nRaspberry Pi OS - Has Debian as a parent\nArch - A bare bones OS for full customization\nFedora - The prefered distro of Linus Torvalds\nRedhat - Fedora’s parent. Frequently used for enterprise applications\n\nFor more on different Linux distributions, see the Distro Family Tree from distrowatch.com.\nFor more on GNU/Linux, watch The Making of GNU: The World’s First Open-Source Software and The Making of Linux: The World’s First Open-Source Operating System by ForrestKnight.",

We access the value stored at the memory address 0x104 which is 0xAB.\nSolution: 0xAB\n$0x108\nSince this value has a $ in front of it, this represents an immediate value. That is, it represents itself, 0x108.\nSolution: 0x108\n(%rax)\nrax holds the value 0x100. The parentheses tell us that we are going to need to visit memory and get the value at 0x100. The value stored at 0x100 is 0xFF.\nSolution: 0xFF\n4(%rax)\nrax holds the value 0x100. The parentheses tell us that we need to visit memory. Specifically, since there is a 4 out front, we need to visit the memory addresss that is 4 over from the address stored in rax. We then get the value from there.\nThus, %rax holds 0x100, and 4 memory locations over from 0x100 is memory location 0x104.\nThe value at 0x104 is 0xAB\nSolution: 0xAB\n9(%rax, %rdx)\n%rax holds 0x100.%rdxholds0x3`.\nWe need to add these two values together to get a resulting address.

We add the value of I to the base value B.\n\nS is the scale for the index. We scale the value of I by S. The value of S must be 1, 2, 4, or 8.\n\nA is a shift, similar to I. We add A to the result of applying I and S to B.\n\n\n\nExamples\nThe following are semi-abstract, descriptive examples that describe the memory address that gets accessed (assuming the instruction we are using would dereference it).\n\n9(%rax)\n\nAssume rax is storing a memory address.\nWe shift 9 memory addresses over from the address stored at rax.\nWe access the value stored at that resulting address.\n\n(%rbx, %rdi)\n\nAssume rbx is storing a memory address.\nrdi stores a value that we will add to rbx to get a new memory address.\nThe parenthesis will tell us to access the value at that final memory address.\n\n-12(%rbx, %rdi)\n\nAssume rbx is storing a memory address.\nrdi stores a value we need to add to that memory address to get a resulting memory address\n-12 tells us to subtract 12 from the previous memory address to get a new memory address\nAccess the value at that final memory address.\n\n(,%rdi,4)\n\nrdi is storing a value that gets multiplied by 4\nAssume the resulting value is a memory address that we can visit.\nWe get the value at that memory address.\n\n10(,%rdi,4)\n\nrdi is storing a value that gets multiplied by 4\nAssume the resulting value is a memory address that we can visit.\nShift 10 memory addresses over from the previously resulting memory address.\nAccess that value.\n\n10(%rbx, %rdi, 4)\n\nAssume rbx stores a memory location\nMultiply the value stored at rdi by 4 and then add the result to the memory location stored in rbx for a new resulting memory address.\nNow shift 10 memory addresses over from the previous result.\nAccess the value at that address.",
