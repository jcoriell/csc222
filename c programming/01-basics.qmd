## Introduction

Before completing any of the following, be sure your system can compile c programs. To check, open the terminal and type `gcc --version`. `gcc` is the GNU compiler for the C programming language. If you hit an error, you need to install it using one of the following:

```sh
# On Ubuntu

# this command installs gcc, g++, libc6-dev, make, and dpkg-dev
sudo apt-get build-essential
```

## Hello World!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Hello World!"); // No new line unless you say to do it.
    printf("Hello again!\n"); // Now has a new line
    printf("Hello there!");

    return 0;
}
```
